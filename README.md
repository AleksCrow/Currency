### Endpoints:

/swagger-ui/ - swagger

/average/update - update databases<br>
/average/result - resul–µ by last update<br>
/average/filter?startTime[yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh-MM-ss]&endTime[yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh-MM-ss] - filter by time. Can be used one of parameters

Minfin api replaced on mock api in application.properties
Controlers for different proveders can be deleted or used for update app

There are some inaccuracies in the implementation: privat api not have time, and time data created after update, so if update it often, it can affect the results in filter by time

The task is a little unfinished - no tests. I understand that this is important. But I couldn't keep up with the time
